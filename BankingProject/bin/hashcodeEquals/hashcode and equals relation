Yes            |      No        | Duplicate  | Stored in same bucket.

                                             | Because, the default(Object) equals method will check only the reference of objects.     

No             |      Yes       | Duplicate  | Stored in different buckets.
											   Treated as different object

Yes(hashlogic) |      Yes       | Unique     | Stored in same bucket.Treated as same object.Efficient.

Yes(constant)  |      Yes       | Unique     | Stored in same bucket.Treated as same object.
                                             | Inefficient, because it will iterate bucket elements for equality check.
